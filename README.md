# Marker

Marker is Erlang Markdown library, including parser and renderer.
The project has been created during the SpawnFest 2021 hackathon and consists of
two parts:

* `marker` Erlang library in `marker/` dir exporting functions for parsing and rendering
* web demo in `marker-web/` dir (TBD) presenting the way Markdown documents are parsed and rendered into HTML
