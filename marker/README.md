# marker

An OTP library for parsing and rendering Markdown documents.

Currently supports a few basic parts of CommonMark specification listed [here](https://commonmark.org/help/).

The goal is to support full [CommonMark specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/) and then add add support for the others, e.g. [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
